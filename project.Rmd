```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)

listings <- read_excel("9Dec2019_PriceAmenitiesRatings.xlsx")
summary(listings)

# Standardise all cleaning_fee such that entries with "NA" are 0 
listings1$cleaning_fee[is.na(listings1$cleaning_fee)]=0

# Add a new column with normalised prices (pro-rata per person for a 3-day stay)
# this is to account for the cleaning_fee, which can be substantial
listings1$price_n <- with(listings1,(price*3 + cleaning_fee)/3/guests_included)
